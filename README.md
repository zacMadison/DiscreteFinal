# README
The actual game is located in the Program directory, just extract and run the .exe

I also included the Unity project if you wanted to look at my scripts, which are located in assets (a few are in the scripts folder inside of assets, its messy)

If you would like to open the project in unity just download the project, selecct "Add project from disk" in Unity Hub, and select "hw6_warioware_zachm"
